## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for technical interview preparation, featuring a vast collection of coding problems from different domains. The solutions provided in this repository are written in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── Problem1
│ ├── Solution.cpp
│ └── README.md
├── Problem2
│ ├── Solution.cpp
│ └── README.md
├── ...
└── ProblemN
├── Solution.cpp
└── README.md


Each problem has its own directory, named `Problem_Question`. Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:

- `Problem_question.cpp`: The C++ implementation of the problem solution.
- `README.md`: The Problem along with it's difficulty level(easy,medium,hard) along with example test cases and constraints.

## How to Use

To use the solutions provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LeetcodeProblem_Solutions.git
````
#
2.Navigate to the desired problem directory:

cd LeetcodeProblem_Solutions/Problem

Replace 'Problem_Question' with the specific problem directory you want to access.

3.Open the 'Probelm_Question.cpp' file to view the implementation.

4.Read the accompanying 'README.md' file to view the problem.

5.Compile and run the solution using your preferred C++ compiler.
