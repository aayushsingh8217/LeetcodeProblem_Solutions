## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for technical interview preparation, featuring a vast collection of coding problems from different domains. The solutions provided in this repository are written in C++.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── Problem1
│ ├── Solution.cpp
│ └── README.md
├── Problem2
│ ├── Solution.cpp
│ └── README.md
├── ...
└── ProblemN
├── Solution.cpp
└── README.md


Each problem has its own directory, named `ProblemN`, where `N` represents the problem number. Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:

- `Solution.cpp`: The C++ implementation of the problem solution.
- `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the problem and solution approach, along with analysis of time and space complexity.
